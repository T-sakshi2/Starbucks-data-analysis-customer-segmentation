# Starbucks Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and segmenting Starbucks customers to understand their behavior and preferences. The goal is to create meaningful customer segments using clustering techniques and to visualize customer profiles based on various demographic and interaction data. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, clustering, and visualization of customer segments.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data**: Import the datasets for transcript, profile, and portfolio.
2. **Initial Inspection**: Check data types, inspect the first few rows, and get an overview of each dataset.
3. **Handling Missing Values and Duplicates**: Remove duplicates and unnecessary columns, and handle missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the distributions of various features such as customer demographics and interaction events.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers in numerical columns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as membership duration, age groups, and income groups.

### Data Merging and Encoding

1. **Data Merging**: Combine the datasets based on common identifiers and relevant events.
2. **Categorical Encoding**: Encode categorical variables for modeling.

### Data Scaling and Clustering

1. **Data Scaling**: Standardize and normalize the data to prepare for clustering.
2. **Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data.

### Visualization

1. **Customer Segments**: Visualize the distribution and characteristics of each customer segment using bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
2. **Cluster Visualization**: Use t-SNE and PCA to visualize the clusters in 2D space.
3. **Word Clouds**: Generate word clouds to represent frequently occurring terms in customer interactions.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features such as membership duration and demographic groups.
- **Clustering**: Application of K-Means clustering and visualization of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Various charts and plots to understand customer segments and their characteristics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use of PCA and t-SNE to visualize customer data in reduced dimensions.
